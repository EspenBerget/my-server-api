# Tinkering with Deno
This repository is my attempt to learn about Deno and it's ecosystem. It contains a server app and a client web app.
The server is a simple sql server with a minimal api. The client is a Svelte app which is only ment to show the server utility.

## This Repo
This repo contains some code I made and wrote about in [my blog][link]

## Try It
Just open two terminals, in one cd to backend and run `deno run --allow-all index.js` and in the other cd to frontend and run
`npm install` then `npm run dev`. Go to the address given in the output to see the site.
